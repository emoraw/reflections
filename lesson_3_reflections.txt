When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repository will keep work accessible when not on local computer.  It will also help with collaboration.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic updates could interfere with local work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are on a single repository, clones are a copy of existing repository (can be between one or two repositories), and forks are a specific clones from one GitHub repository to another.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This will reduce conflicts since most changes will be based on this last known state of the remote stored locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

With Git, collaboration includes a lot more prep work to define when people will access work to make updates.  This is easier because we are not using a version control software that all users need to understand.  However, the challenges include not being able to easily merge work, not being able to restore changes to an earlier point, etc.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?
