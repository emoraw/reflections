What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates a known system for git to track. 
A hidden file '.git' is added so that commits can be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is temporary storage, while working directory and repository are more concrete.  
The value of the staging area is to see the next checkpoint before officially saving as a checkpoint; it helps create the specifics of the checkpoint.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use command 'git diff' to compare the working directory and the staging area.  
You can also use 'git dif --staged' to compare the staging area to the most recent commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Braches would be helpful when making significantly altered changes/timings/numbers to current master branch, but same functionality idea (changing asteroids splitting from 3 to 2, increasing speed at which enemies appear, etc.)
Branches could also help add and test out a whole new feature. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help show what commits are available for each branch.  In other words, what commits will appear when using command 'git log'.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Pros of auto merging: faster, systematic, minimizes human error
Cons of auto merging: potential misinterpretation, person A and B could both delete a function and replace with their own functionality not caught by the merge
Pros of manual merging: theoretically reduces errors from incorrect functionality merging.
Cons of manual merging: slower, could still create human error
