What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates a known system for git to track. 
A hidden file '.git' is added so that commits can be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is temporary storage, while working directory and repository are more concrete.  
The value of the staging area is to see the next checkpoint before officially saving as a checkpoint; it helps create the specifics of the checkpoint.
